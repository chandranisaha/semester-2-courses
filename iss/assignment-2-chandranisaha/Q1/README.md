#Q1: P1

ASSUMPTIONS:
a) rollno is hardcoded into the code instead of taking input from user
b) only unique prime digits are printed, duplicates are removed using set()
c) the prime digits list is sorted in ascending order

#Q1: P2

ASSUMPTIONS:
a) rollno is hardcoded into the code instead of taking input from user
b) only unique ODD digits are printed, duplicates are removed using set()
c) the ODD digits list is sorted in ascending order

#Q1: P3

ASSUMPTIONS:
a) rollno is hardcoded into the code instead of taking input from user
b) only unique EVEN digits are printed, duplicates are removed using set()
c) the EVEN digits list is sorted in ascending order

#Q1: P4

ASSUMPTIONS:
a) rollno is hardcoded into the code instead of taking input from user
b) boolean values are treated like integers 1 for True and 0 for False
c) order of digits does not matter in counting the number of zeros since only count is printed

#Q1: P5

ASSUMPTIONS:
a) rollno is hardcoded into the code instead of taking input from user
b) zero is counted to be divisible in all cases
c) order of digits does not matter in counting the number of digits since only count is pri>
