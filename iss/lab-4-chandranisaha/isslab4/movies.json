A ten-year-old boy named Carlos, the son of a fallen Republican war hero, is left by his tutor in an orphanage in the middle of nowhere. The orphanage is run by a curt but considerate headmistress named Carmen and a kindly Professor Casares, both of whom are sympathetic to the doomed Republican cause. Despite their concern for him, and his gradual triumph over the usual schoolhouse bully, Carlos never feels completely comfortable in his new environment. First of all, there was that initial encounter with the orphanage's nasty caretaker, Jacinto, who reacts even more violently when anyone is caught looking around a particular storage room the one with the deep well. Second, and more inexplicable, is the presence of a ghost, one of the former occupants of the orphanage named Santi. Not long after Carlos' arrival, Santi latches onto Carlos, badgering him incessantly at night and gloomily intoning, \"Many of you will die.\" As if that wasn't enough to keep the orphanage's occupants in an unrelenting state of terror, there's the un-exploded bomb that dominates the orphanage's courtyard, still ticking away; With the orphanage left defenseless by its isolation, and the swift progression of Franco's troops, the ghost's prediction seems depressingly accurate. Nevertheless, with every step of the plot, it becomes apparent that the ghost's predictions as to who (or what) will die, the real source of danger and even the definition of death itself may be more ambiguous than first thought.","imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":43442,"id":256009},"year":2001,"plot":"After Carlos, a 12-year-old whose father has died in the Spanish Civil War, arrives at an ominous boy's orphanage he discovers the school is haunted and has many dark secrets that he must uncover.","genres":["Drama","Horror"],"rated":"R","metacritic":78,"title":"The Devil's Backbone","lastupdated":"2015-08-18 01:17:25.860000000","languages":["Spanish"],"writers":["Guillermo del Toro","Antonio Trashorras","David Muèoz"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.sonyclassics.com/devilsbackbone/index.htm","viewer":{"rating":3.9,"numReviews":34023,"meter":89},"dvd":{"$date":"2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.6,"numReviews":117,"meter":92},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-23T18:37:24Z"},"consensus":"Creepily atmospheric and haunting, The Devil's Backbone is both a potent ghost story and an intelligent political allegory.","rotten":9,"production":"Sony Pictures Classics","fresh":108},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI3MDcwZGItZDMwNS00ZDBjLWEwOGEtMWEyMWUxNDlkYzBjL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":2,"released":{"$date":"2001-04-20T00:00:00Z"},"awards":{"wins":6,"nominations":7,"text":"6 wins & 7 nominations."},"countries":["Spain","Mexico","Argentina"],"cast":["Marisa Paredes","Eduardo Noriega","Federico Luppi","Fernando Tielve"],"directors":["Guillermo del Toro"],"runtime":106}

In the intervening years, ostentatious houses have sprung up around him. He's been at the same architectural firm for twenty years in a job he hates, which primarily consists of building scale models. On the day that he is fired from his job, he is diagnosed with an advanced case of terminal cancer, which he chooses not to disclose to his family. In many ways, this day is the happiest of his recent life in that he decides to spend what little time he has left doing what he really wants to do, namely build a house he can call his own to replace the shack. He also wants his rebellious sixteen year old son, Sam Monroe, to live with him for the summer, hopefully not only to help in the house construction, but for the two to reconnect as a family. Getting Sam to do any of it will not be an easy task as Sam, who has embarked on some self-destructive behavior, would rather do anything than spend time with his family, which also includes his mother Robin Kimball, her wealthy but emotionally unaffectionate husband Peter Kimball, and their adolescent children. In Sam, George sees an unhappy person in every aspect of his life, much like George was himself before that fateful day. What Sam decides to do for the summer may consider Alyssa Beck, his pretty classmate and George's next door neighbor. Through the process, George also reconnects with Robin, who admits that she's made some pretty bad decisions in her life. He may not want that reconnection to go too far considering his health. Ultimately George has much to do to complete all he wants before he dies.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2001-11-09T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Irwin Winkler"],"writers":["Mark Andrus"],"awards":{"wins":4,"nominations":7,"text":"Nominated for 1 Golden Globe.

His womanizing father, Vincente, is on the most part absent as a traveling salesman, he who seems more concerned about his own fortunes than sending money home to take care of his mother and son. Valentèn has dreams like most young boys, his primary one being to become an astronaut. He believes the work that he does building rocket models and space suits will assist the NASA space program, and he does whatever he can, such as walk around in heavy shoes to simulate zero gravity and hold his breath underwater, in his pursuit of becoming an astronaut, despite being slightly cross-eyed and near-sighted, which he believes will not hinder his chances. But without really realizing it, he wants more than anything to be part of a nuclear family, with his father at home and for his father to marry a pretty young woman he can call his mother. He believes Vincente's latest girlfriend, Leticia, is that woman. In the absence of a constant male influence at home, Valentèn searches those out, whether it being his Uncle Chiche who is visiting from Ushuaia, or Rufo, the bohemian pianist who lives next door. Valentèn tries to solve what he sees as the problems in his life to varying degrees of success, and comes to some new understandings which reconciles what he has been inadvertently told in the past and what he now sees in life.","languages":["Spanish"],"released":{"$date":"2003-02-06T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Alejandro Agresti"],"writers":["Alejandro Agresti"],"awards":{"wins":14,"nominations":8,"text":"14 wins & 8 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-07 00:30:57.130000000","year":2002,"imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":3535,"id":296915},"countries":["Argentina","Netherlands","France","Spain","Italy"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.miramax.com/valentin/index.html","viewer":{"rating":4.1,"numReviews":4846,"meter":93},"dvd":{"$date":"2004-10-12T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":6.1,"numReviews":66,"meter":61},"boxOffice":"$0.3M","consensus":"A coming-of-age tale that's more cloying than affecting.","rotten":26,"production":"Miramax Films","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-15T17:16:38Z"},"fresh":40},"num_mflix_comments":0}

These birds travel several hundreds if not thousands of miles toward the equator in the autumn, and make the return journey to their higher latitude summer homes in the spring, always taking the same route, using the natural compasses of the universe, the stars, to find their way. Some species, like the arctic tern, even fly from pole to pole. These long and often torturous treks are a matter of survival, to live in a hospitable climate and find sources of food. With the exception of migratory penguins, travel over oceans is especially difficult as the birds have little refuge unless there is something floating on the water, such as a ship, on which to land. Otherwise they must continue flying until they reach land. Some will not survive the migration due to predators, including man, illness or injury. Although the migrations themselves are done as a community, once the birds reach their respective summer and winter homes, they disperse into family units.

His interactions with his co-workers offer some relief from the monotony, and their discussions encompass everything from music to the decline of American culture to new flavors of jellybeans and life itself. At home, Harvey fills his days with reading, writing and listening to jazz. His apartment is filled with thousands of books and LPs, and he regularly scours Cleveland's thrift stores and garage sales for more, savoring the rare joy of a 25-cent find. It is at one of these junk sales that Harvey meets Robert Crumb, a greeting card artist and music enthusiast. When, years later, Crumb finds international success for his underground comics, the idea that comic books can be a valid art form for adults inspires Harvey to write his own brand of comic book. An admirer of naturalist writers like Theodore Dreiser, Harvey makes his American Splendor a truthful, unsentimental record of his working-class life, a warts-and-all self portrait. First published in 1976, the comic earns Harvey cult fame throughout the 1980s and eventually leads him to the sardonic Joyce Barber, a partner in a Delaware comic book store who end ups being Harvey's true soul mate as they experience the bizarre byproducts of Harvey's cult celebrity stature.","imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":40321,"id":305206},"year":2003,"plot":"An original mix of fiction and reality illuminates the life of comic book hero everyman Harvey Pekar.","genres":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"rated":"R","metacritic":90,"title":"American Splendor","lastupdated":"2015-09-04 00:23:46.477000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Harvey Pekar (comic book series American Splendor)","Joyce Brabner (comic book series Our Cancer Year)","Shari Springer Berman","Robert Pulcini"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.americansplendormovie.com/main.html","viewer":{"rating":3.7,"numReviews":44077,"meter":86},"dvd":{"$date":"2008-10-18T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":8.3,"numReviews":181,"meter":94},"boxOffice":"$6.0M","consensus":"Exhilarating both stylistically and for its entertaining, moving portrayal of an everyman, American Splendor is a portrait of a true underground original.","rotten":11,"production":"Fine Line Features","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-23T18:05:59Z"},"fresh":170},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MjYxNjY1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkwMjAwMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":0,"released":{"$date":"2003-09-12T00:00:00Z"},"awards":{"wins":34,"nominations":39,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Daniel's wife has just passed away, leaving him to take care of his adolescent stepson Sam by himself. Daniel is uncertain how to deal with Sam and his problems without his wife present, especially in light of a potential budding romance within their household. Juliet and Peter have just gotten married. They believe that Peter's best friend and best man Mark hates Juliet but won't say so to his or her face. Others looking at the situation from the outside believe Mark is jealous of Juliet as he is in love with Peter himself. Jamie, a writer, is taking a writing retreat by himself in rural France following catching his latest girlfriend in an indiscretion. Jamie ends up spending much time in France with Aurèlia, the Portuguese woman hired as the housekeeper. The question becomes not only if they can communicate their day-to-day needs with each other as she speaks no English, he speaks no Portuguese, and neither speaks French well, but communicate what seems to be their increasing mutual attraction to each other. Sarah has been in love with her co-worker Karl for the two years they have worked together, this attraction which everyone in their workplace knows about. Sarah has to decide if she can be forward enough to express this love directly to Karl, especially in light of what has been her personal priority of dealing with a family issue. Harry and Karen have been in a stable long term marriage. His new assistant Mia drops hints to him that she would like them to be romantically involved. Harry has to decide whether to fall to the temptation, especially considering being married to a perceptive wife. Single and relatively young David is the newly elected Prime Minister. At 10 Downing Street, he is attracted to one of the new household servants, slightly overweight Natalie, but isn't sure what to do about it seeing as to their respective positions, the probable public scrutiny, and an incident involving the visiting U.S. President. Socially unaware Colin believes that the lack of romantic love in his life is all the fault of standoffish British women. As such, he decides to take decisive albeit somewhat unusual geographic action. And John and Judy are movie body doubles. They can communicate with each other straightforwardly while they are simulating sex filming a movie, but they may not be able to translate the feelings behind that simulation in real life to each other.","imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":292304,"id":314331},"year":2003,"plot":"Follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England.","genres":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"rated":"R","metacritic":55,"title":"Love Actually","lastupdated":"2015-09-05 00:57:24.743000000","languages":["English","Portuguese","French"],"writers":["Richard Curtis"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.loveactually.com/","viewer":{"rating":3.1,"numReviews":31624521,"meter":73},"dvd":{"$date":"2004-04-27T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":6.4,"numReviews":192,"meter":63},"boxOffice":"$59.4M","consensus":"A sugary tale overstuffed with too many stories.

Slowly even class rebel Liam Mercier is turned around, trough his gift for literature. After Franklin dares stop the sadist's penny-weighted strap severely striking 'sinful scum' for a futility, the whole dorm is treated to an icy night outdoors, arms outstretched wearing only shorts. Brother Mac's mind may mean to educate well, his flesh is too weak for celibacy, so the coy, pretty new boy becomes his latest pederastic lust-object, sworn to suffer sodomy in silence- even devoutly confessing to Father O'Driscoll his fear to have lost his innocence during painful rape costs him an endless cold shower, shivering stark-naked before his tormentor. Constructing a nativity stall for the village church allows Franklin's class to grow close, have fun and earn praise, but after the Peters brothers cross the forbidden red lines to hug each-other on Christmas night across the wall separating the age sections, John punishes their 'blasphemous abomination' (?!) by publicly flogging their bare backs to bloody pulp till Franklin arrives. Still the prefect is capable of viler abuse: Liam, who sent a boy to get Franklin and received a book with dedication from that 'communist', privately gets the sturdy strap in the face till even secret-blackmailed brother Mac can't watch the orgy of child-abuse any more, but now Franklin arrives so late...","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2003-08-22T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Aisling Walsh"],"writers":["Aisling Walsh","Kevin Byron Murphy","Patrick Galvin"],"awards":{"wins":14,"nominations":6,"text":"14 wins & 6 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-15 00:03:16.583000000","year":2003,"imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":2709,"id":339707},"countries":["Ireland","UK","Denmark","Spain"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.1,"numReviews":2085,"meter":89},"dvd":{"$date":"2007-05-08T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":5.8,"numReviews":6,"meter":67},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-25T18:08:44Z"},"rotten":2,"fresh":4},"num_mflix_comments":0}

Every standard by which we set our social and cultural clocks was either turned inside out or thrown away completely and reinvented. For American cinema, the 1970s was an era during which a new generation of filmmakers created work for a new kind of audience--moviegoers who were hungry for stories that reflected their own experiences and who were turning their backs on aged old studio formulas. As a result, emerging filmmakers influenced by foreign directors such as Godard, Kurosawa and Fellini coupled with the social climate and a struggling studio system, converged to create a new kind of moviemaking. Through their choice of material, filmmakers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, William Friedkin, Roger Corman and Paul Schrader revolutionized mainstream movies and for the first time personal visions were coming out of the studio system.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2003-01-19T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Ted Demme","Richard LaGravenese"],"rated":"R","awards":{"wins":2,"nominations":1,"text":"Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy.

But deep inside, Jim Braddock never relinquished his determination. Driven by love, honor and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. No one thought he had a shot. However Braddock, fueled by something beyond mere competition, kept winning. Suddenly, the ordinary working man became the mythic athlete. Carrying the hopes and dreams of the disenfranchised on his shoulders, Braddock rocketed through the ranks, until this underdog chose to do the unthinkable: take on the heavyweight champ of the world, the unstoppable Max Baer, renowned for having killed two men in the ring.","imdb":{"rating":8.0,"votes":140006,"id":352248},"year":2005,"plot":"The story of James Braddock, a supposedly washed-up boxer who came back to become a champion and an inspiration in the 1930s.","genres":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"rated":"PG-13","metacritic":69,"title":"Cinderella Man","lastupdated":"2015-09-07 00:12:40.283000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Cliff Hollingsworth (screenplay)","Akiva Goldsman (screenplay)","Cliff Hollingsworth (story)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.cinderellamanmovie.com","viewer":{"rating":3.8,"numReviews":281112,"meter":91},"dvd":{"$date":"2005-12-06T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.4,"numReviews":209,"meter":80},"boxOffice":"$61.6M","consensus":"With grittiness and an evocative sense of time and place, Cinderella Man is a powerful underdog story.

Following the work of the late cultural anthropologist, Ernest Becker, and his Pulitzer Prize-winning book Denial of Death, this documentary explores the ongoing research of a group of social psychologists that may forever change the way we look at ourselves and the world. Over the last twenty-five years, this team of researchers has conducted over 300 laboratory studies, which substantiate Becker's claim that death anxiety is a primary motivator of human behavior, specifically aggression and violence. Flight from Death features an all-star cast of scholars, authors, philosophers, and researchers including Sam Keen, Robert Jay Lifton, Irvin Yalom, and Sheldon Solomon culminating in a film that is \"not only thought-provoking but also entertaining and put together with a lot of class\" (Eric Campos, Film Threat).

In the mid-twentieth century, it is run by the principal M. Rachin, an egotistical disciplinarian whose official unofficial mantra for the school is \"action - reaction\", meaning that there will be severe consequences for any boy out of line. This approach does not seem to be working as the boys as a collective are an unruly bunch. In turn, the teachers don't teach, but are always watching out for the next subversive act from the boys. January 15, 1949 marks the arrival to the school of the new supervisor, M. Clèment Mathieu, a middle-aged man who is grasping at finding his place in life after a series of failed endeavors. Although he does find the boys an unruly lot, Mathieu does not believe in the \"action - reaction\" policy, and as such, butts heads with Rachin while secretly undermining the policy. Slowly, Mathieu's approach of trying to match the discipline to the crime does have a positive effect on a handful of students. With the reluctant approval of Rachin, Mathieu begins a grander experiment of trying to transform the overall atmosphere within the school, core within the experiment being to start a choir among his students. This move is a difficult one for him as a failed musician, as well as for the initially reluctant students. During this process, Mathieu focuses on two different students for two different reasons. Pèpinot, a younger boy, seems to lack guidance and focus, and who always says he is waiting for Saturday when his father will pick him up, he who never does. And Pierre Morhange, an older student, is the anachronism: introverted, but prone to outbursts of individual subversiveness - the devil with the face of an angel as the other teachers describe him. Behind the reason for his subversiveness, which Mathieu slowly learns, Morhange hides a love of music and a true talent in it. Beyond overcoming the obvious obstacles of Rachin and the students' skepticism and Rachin's egotism, Mathieu has another challenge in newly arrived Pascal Mondain, a truly troubled older boy with pathological tendencies whose presence alone may wreak havoc throughout the school, and not just with Mathieu's project. Over fifty years later, Morhange and Pèpinot, who have not seen each other since that time and who did not spend that much time together while at school, are reading through Mathieu's memoirs from his time at the school, which unmasks the reason why the two are privy to the memoir and the effect he had on their lives.","languages":["French"],"released":{"$date":"2004-03-17T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Christophe Barratier"],"writers":["Georges Chaperot","Renè Wheeler","Renè Wheeler","Noèl-Noèl","Christophe Barratier (screen story)","Christophe Barratier (screenplay)","Philippe Lopes-Curval (screenplay)"],"awards":{"wins":14,"nominations":21,"text":"Nominated for 2 Oscars.

His friendship with Albrecht, the ascetic son of the area's governor, is central to this education; a night in the forest hunting for escaped Russian POWs brings things to a head.","languages":["German"],"released":{"$date":"2005-01-13T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Dennis Gansel"],"writers":["Dennis Gansel","Maggie Peren"],"awards":{"wins":8,"nominations":6,"text":"8 wins & 6 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-15 05:38:46.683000000","year":2004,"imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":10179,"id":384369},"countries":["Germany"],"type":"movie"}

Fourteen year old Ralph Walker is in many ways a typical teenager. He is experimenting with smoking and is openly preoccupied with the opposite sex, which makes him the brunt of jokes amongst his male classmates and which constantly gets him into trouble with the school's strict headmaster, Father Fitzpatrick. As penance and to redirect his energies, Father Fitzpatrick orders Ralph to join the school's cross country running team under the tutelage of the school's avant-garde thinking teacher, Father Hibbert. Some of the more unusual circumstances of Ralph's life are that he lives by himself in the family home, telling the authorities that he is living with his paternal grandparents (who are in reality deceased), and telling his widowed hospitalized mother (Ralph's father was killed in the war) that he is staying with a friend. Ralph's focus in life changes after his mother falls into a coma. It will take a miracle for her to come out of that coma. After two unrelated and somewhat innocent comments made to Ralph by Father Hibbert on prayer, purity and faith and running the Boston Marathon, Ralph believes that that miracle will be him winning the 1954 Boston Marathon for which he only has 180 days to train. To obtain the necessary physical and spiritual requirements to achieve this goal, Ralph receives some help from his friends Claire Collins and Chester Jones, and from one of the hospital's compassionate nurses named Alice. Although he believes Ralph's mission is misguided, Father Hibbert, who has his own secret past running history, becomes Ralph's personal trainer. These actions place Father Hibbert and Ralph at odds with Father Fitzpatrick, who sees his and other authority figures' roles as needing to show Ralph his place in life.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2005-04-08T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Michael McGowan"],"writers":["Michael McGowan"],"awards":{"wins":6,"nominations":9,"text":"6 wins & 9 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-18 00:07:33.580000000","year":2004,"imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":4869,"id":384488},"countries":["Canada"],"type":"movie","num_mflix_comments":0}

This passionate and fluid film is without question the first authentic history of surfing from its humble Hawaiian beginnings to the big business it became to the still-rebellious universe it inhabits today. Riding Giants is a study in individuality and freedom, the pursuit and techniques of pure kinetic pleasure, and the risk taking and attitudes that characterize its leading figures. For some viewers, this is perhaps more than they ever wanted to know. But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle, its icons and locations, its boom and exploitation by the media, and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike. Closely chronicling the sometimes-life-and-death drama that big-wave riding entails, Riding Giants is an often-mesmerizing visual thrill ride. But the most appealing aspect of this often revelatory documentary is the realization that the man versus nature dialectic never ends; the search for the ultimate wave and the spiritual pinnacle can only be pursued but never reached.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2004-08-13T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Stacy Peralta"],"writers":["Stacy Peralta","Sam George"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":1,"text":"1 win & 1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-19 00:40:16.063000000","year":2004,"imdb":{"rating":7.9,"votes":3676,"id":389326},"countries":["USA","France"],"type":"movie"}

Finally, this Blues family tree shows off vibrant new growth as it reveals the Blues' influence on our modern wealth of talented musicians (Midnight Special performed by John Fogerty and Hound Dog done by Macy Gray). Ruth Brown gives Blll Cosby a full-throttle serenade (and a playful smoldering gaze), along with Mavis Staples and Natalie Cole. Angèlique Kidjo persuades Buddy Guy to an unforgettable rendition of 'Voodoo Child,' shortly before Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray accompany B.B. King and Lucille for the final number, 'Paying the Cost to be the Boss.' This documentary presents to the audience, with authority and candor, an authentic history of this musical form. The highly esteemed elders of this musical family are exemplary in their humbleness toward one another, rich with decades of shared memories; and their performances are of a quality rarely seen in modern times. These men and women are true artisans, yet they continue to generously pass their legacy down to select members of each musical generation. Those who grew up on this music find themselves performing on the stage with the very heroes who served as their earliest inspiration. Legends, such as Ruth Brown, Honeyboy Edwards, Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown, B.B. King, Howling Wolf, and Buddy Guy, gave the world a double helping of their genius-first with song and secondly as the spirit which supplies the continuation of their art: in such artists as Natalie Cole, Jimmie Vaughan, John Fogerty, Macy Gray, Alison Krause, and Bonnie Raitt.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2004-08-05T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Antoine Fuqua"],"rated":"PG-13","awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":2,"text":"1 win & 2 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-10 17:39:50.593000000","year":2004,"imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":532,"id":396705},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","num_mflix_comments":0}

At the heart of the series is the tempestuous relationship between Margaret Hale, a young woman from a southern middle class family who finds herself uprooted to the north, and John Thornton, a formerly poverty-stricken cotton mill owner terrified of losing the viability of his business. Around them are class struggles between the workers and mill owners and ideological struggles between the industrial North and the agrarian South. After moving North, Margaret's father befriends his student Mr. Thornton. Margaret has already formed her opinion of Mr. Thornton independently after seeing him treat his workers harshly. As the series progresses, she and we the audience begin to learn that his strict treatment is due to an overarching concern for his mill and by extension, his employees. John Thornton, on the other hand, is attracted to Margaret's independence and position in society as a well-educated Southerner. As in \"Pride and Prejudice\" the marriage proposal comes in the middle of the series and is rejected by Margaret.

{"_id":{"$oid":"573a13b2f29313caabd391ca"},"fullplot":"Each winter, alone in the pitiless ice deserts of Antarctica, deep in the most inhospitable terrain on Earth, a truly remarkable journey takes place as it has done for millennia. Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers' limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.","imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":40127,"id":428803},"year":2005,"plot":"A look at the annual journey of Emperor penguins as they march -- single file -- to their traditional breeding ground.","genres":["Documentary"],"rated":"G","metacritic":79,"title":"March of the Penguins","lastupdated":"2015-09-06 00:04:58.977000000","languages":["French","English"],"writers":["Luc Jacquet (scenario)","Luc Jacquet (adaptation)","Michel Fessler (adaptation)","Jordan Roberts (narration: US edited version)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/","viewer":{"rating":3.5,"numReviews":99388,"meter":81},"dvd":{"$date":"2005-11-29T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.8,"numReviews":180,"meter":94},"boxOffice":"$77.4M","consensus":"Only the most hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc.","rotten":10,"production":"Warner Independent Pictures","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-16T18:54:16Z"},"fresh":170},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDc5MDYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMzNDAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":{"$date":"2005-07-22T00:00:00Z"},"awards":{"wins":24,"nominations":12,"text":"Won 1 Oscar.

While Subhash adores both his sons, he shows his open disappointment for Vishnu, whose language, childish actions, and his affair with a Bollywood actress named Sapna are just few of his wrong actions. When Vishnu finds out that a Bollywood actor is attempting to start an affair with Sapna, he angrily guns him down in front of several witnesses. Subhash asks Vishnu to leave the house, and thereafter Vishnu is arrested and charged with murder. Then all hell breaks lose in the Nagre household when a politician named Motilal Khurana is killed, and the killer names Subhash as the person who hired him to do this killing. Subhash is arrested, and held in prison - there is no hope for him in the courts as he has been already been found guilty - not for this killing - but for acting as a power unto himself - a mafia-like Godfather - who metes out justice - when justice fails. Watch how circumstances force Subhash to come to terms that he no longer is influential and no one will come forward to assist him; Shankar is abducted and disappears, and the one who has hired to kill him is none other than his son - Vishnu.","languages":["Hindi","Marathi"],"released":{"$date":"2005-07-01T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Ram Gopal Varma"],"writers":["Manish Gupta"],"awards":{"wins":2,"nominations":5,"text":"2 wins & 5 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-01 00:56:15.063000000","year":2005,"imdb":{"rating":7.8,"votes":7642,"id":432047},"countries":["India"],"type":"movie"}

Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers' limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.","imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":40076,"id":428803},"year":2005,"plot":"A look at the annual journey of Emperor penguins as they march -- single file -- to their traditional breeding ground.","genres":["Documentary"],"rated":"G","metacritic":79,"title":"March of the Penguins","lastupdated":"2015-09-02 10:41:01.727000000","languages":["French","English"],"writers":["Luc Jacquet (scenario)","Luc Jacquet (adaptation)","Michel Fessler (adaptation)","Jordan Roberts (narration: US edited version)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/","viewer":{"rating":3.5,"numReviews":99388,"meter":81},"dvd":{"$date":"2005-11-29T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.8,"numReviews":180,"meter":94},"boxOffice":"$77.4M","consensus":"Only the most hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc.","rotten":10,"production":"Warner Independent Pictures","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-16T18:54:16Z"},"fresh":170},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDc5MDYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMzNDAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":{"$date":"2005-07-22T00:00:00Z"},"awards":{"wins":24,"nominations":12,"text":"Won 1 Oscar.

Eight-year-old Sasha, eleven-year-old Kristina, thirteen-year-old Misha and ten-year-old Andrej all dream of living in a communal home. They spend winter nights trying to stay warm by huddling together on hot water pipes and most of their days are spent begging. Andrej has found himself here because of disagreements with his family. Kristina was driven into this way of life by the hatred of her stepmother and twelve-year-old Roma by the regular beatings he received from his constantly drunk father. \"When it is worst, we try to make money for food by prostitution,\" admits thirteen-year-old Artur. The pair of Polish filmmakers in this raw and very effective documentary even succeeded in filming an incident where the police patrol beat one of the street children and smear an entire tube of glue into his hair and onto his face. It is precisely this sniffing of the glue fumes that gives these children the possibility to at least for a little while escape the unforgiving world around them. It is a life of fleeting possibilities and danger.","languages":["Russian"],"released":{"$date":"2005-01-21T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Andrzej Celinski","Hanna Polak"],"awards":{"wins":3,"nominations":2,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Both a social justice story and a personally driven narrative, the film chronicles this capital case from 1984 through 2004. With exclusive footage from two decades, the film frames the judicial and emotional response to a chilling crime - and the implications that reverberate from Hunt's conviction - against a backdrop of class and racial bias in the South and in the American criminal justice system. This documentary is the culmination of ten years of research and filming. In 1993, inspired by claims of injustice and police conspiracy, the filmmakers began to shoot in North Carolina. Working from a mix of formats (16mm and 24P video) the film melds the visceral reality of a murder case with first person accounts and cinematic imagery, illuminating perceptions and memories of events as they unfolded for the people closest to this haunting story. This unique look at one man's loss and redemption challenges the assumption that all Americans have the right to unbiased justice. Hunt's story - while one man's personal journey - reflects systemic issues of national concern: cross-racial eyewitness identification, prosecutorial misconduct, inexperienced defense attorneys assigned to capital cases, racial bias in death penalty cases and errors in police procedure. Barry Scheck from The Innocence Project, who worked on Hunt's case for ten years, and Gary Wells, professor and eyewitness expert, offer concrete examples where errors occurred in Hunt's saga and offer future remedies and effective ideas to prevent future \"Darryl Hunts.\" Hunt himself addresses the need for systemic reforms to prevent wrongful convictions, underscoring the haunting reality that Hunt could have been sentenced to death and we would never have known this story.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Ricki Stern","Anne Sundberg"],"rated":"PG-13","awards":{"wins":6,"nominations":4,"text":"6 wins & 4 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-01-15 00:00:59.050000000","year":2006,"imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":653,"id":446055},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.breakthrufilms.org/","viewer":{"rating":3.7,"numReviews":2187,"meter":89},"dvd":{"$date":"2007-10-16T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.8,"numReviews":10,"meter":100},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-15T17:44:47Z"},"rotten":0,"production":"ThinkFilm","fresh":10}}

Huo faced personal tragedy but ultimately fought his way out of darkness and into history, defining the true spirit of martial arts. His self-discovery, and the choices he made, inspired his nation. The son of a great fighter who did not wish for his child to follow in his footsteps, the bullied Huo Yuanjia resolves to teach himself how to fight - and win. Years of training enable him to ace match after match in his home region of Tianjin. But as his fame as a martial arts master grows, so does his pride. After an ill-advised fight leads to another master's death, members of Huo's family are slain in revenge. Grieving and ashamed, Huo wanders the country in shock. Near death, he is rescued by women from an idyllic village, and is offered simple kindness and generosity that help him heal and regain his equilibrium over a period of several years. Huo realizes that the future of martial arts lies in sportsmanship and not brutality, and he rejoins society to apply what he has learned. Returning to Tianjin, Huo takes steps to come to terms with his past and restore his family's name. His evolving, graceful Mizong (Missing) Fist method of fighting brings Huo renewed success, and he forms the progressive Jingwu Sports Federation. Taking note, duplicitous members of the Foreign Chamber of Commerce engineer a Shanghai tournament pitting Huo against four fighters, each representing the major foreign powers in China. Huo commits to the bout and faces off against, respectively, a British boxer, a Spanish swordsman, a Belgian soldier, and a Japanese martial artist.

However the suburbs quickly evolved into a merely a place to live that had neither the benefits of rural or urban life, and where one was reliant on an automobile both to travel elsewhere and even travel within the neighborhood. The suburbs are not only dependent upon cheap energy, but also reliable energy. The reliability of energy is becoming less so as demonstrated by the multi-day blackout of the North American Eastern Seaboard starting on August 14, 2003. Part of the problem of getting out of the suburban mentality is that a generation has grown up believing it to be a normal way of life, and a life of entitlement, which they will not give up without a fight. But many developers and planners and some of the general public understand the want and need to make the way the collective we live in a more walkable and humanistic manner.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2004-05-05T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Gregory Greene"],"writers":["Gregory Greene"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":0,"text":"1 win."},"lastupdated":"2015-07-26 00:22:41.180000000","year":2004,"imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":929,"id":446320},"countries":["Canada","USA","France"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.thegroundtruth.net","viewer":{"rating":3.1,"numReviews":12468,"meter":76},"dvd":{"$date":"2006-09-26T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.5,"numReviews":47,"meter":87},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-17T17:28:06Z"},"consensus":"The stories the soldiers have to tell are eye-opening and wrenching to hear; collectively it's a searing peek into the toll of war both during and after.","rotten":6,"production":"Focus Features","fresh":41}}

A small village in Tuscany, 1971. Mirco is a bright, lively 10-year-old, crazy about the movies - especially Westerns and adventure films. His father, an incurable idealist, is a truck driver. One day, while Mirco is playing with an old rifle, the gun accidentally goes off; the boy is shot in the head. He survives, but loses his sight. At that time, Italian law considered blind people hopelessly handicapped, and did not permit them to attend public school. Hence, young Mirco's parents are forced to shut their son up in a \"special school for the blind\": the David Chiossone Institute in Genoa. In the beginning Mirco does not accept his new condition. But he is feisty and determined. When he finds an old tape recorder and a few used reels and discovers that by cutting and splicing tape he can create little fairy tales made only of sounds, a brand-new world opens up to him. His new adventure is opposed by the religious authorities that run the boarding school, who are convinced that a blind boy is a disabled person who must not be allowed to harbor illusions. But Mirco will not give up. He continues to fight in every way possible, and he slowly involves his classmates, leading them to rediscover their dreams and capacities. Then one night, with the help of the only sighted child - the daughter of the doorkeeper, with whom Mirco shares a tender friendship - he convinces the small group of boys to sneak out of school and go to the cinema down the street. For all of them, the experience is exhilarating. But the consequences are grim. Mirco is expelled. In the meantime, a broader struggle to change society is taking place outside. 1970's political protests are erupting. Students are taking to the streets. During one of his earlier escapades, Mirco had made friends with Ettore, a blind university student with strong political awareness. Hearing that Mirco has been expelled, Ettore pushes the whole city to mobilize.

Nevertheless, Wilberforce finds the inspiration in newfound love to rejuvenate the fight with new ideas that would lead to a great victory for social justice.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2007-02-23T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Michael Apted"],"writers":["Steven Knight"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":5,"text":"1 win & 5 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-07 00:00:30.910000000","year":2006,"imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":19698,"id":454776},"countries":["UK","USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.amazinggracemovie.com/","viewer":{"rating":4.0,"numReviews":54076,"meter":85},"dvd":{"$date":"2007-11-13T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":6.6,"numReviews":122,"meter":70},"boxOffice":"$21.2M","consensus":"Amazing Grace is your quintessential historical biopic: stately, noble, and with plenty of electrifying performances.","rotten":37,"production":"Samuel Goldwyn Films LLC","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-30T18:24:13Z"},"fresh":85},"num_mflix_comments":0}

Major media organisations like the BBC and The Guardian crumbled and apologised. But then they sued gardener Helen Steel and postman Dave Morris.

Every aspect of the corporation's business was cross-examined: from junk food and McJobs, to animal cruelty, environmental damage and advertising to children. Outside the courtroom, Dave brought up his young son alone and Helen supported herself working nights in a bar. McDonald's tried every trick in the book against them. Legal manoeuvres. A visit from Ronald McDonald. Top executives flying to London for secret settlement negotiations. Even spies. Seven years later, in February 2005, the marathon legal battle finally concluded at the European Court of Human Rights. And the result took everyone by surprise - especially the British Government. McLibel is not just about hamburgers. It is about the importance of freedom of speech now that multinational corporations are more powerful than countries.

Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers' limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.","imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":40078,"id":428803},"year":2005,"plot":"A look at the annual journey of Emperor penguins as they march -- single file -- to their traditional breeding ground.","genres":["Documentary"],"rated":"G","metacritic":79,"title":"March of the Penguins","lastupdated":"2015-09-02 13:46:58.490000000","languages":["French","English"],"writers":["Luc Jacquet (scenario)","Luc Jacquet (adaptation)","Michel Fessler (adaptation)","Jordan Roberts (narration: US edited version)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/","viewer":{"rating":3.5,"numReviews":99388,"meter":81},"dvd":{"$date":"2005-11-29T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.8,"numReviews":180,"meter":94},"boxOffice":"$77.4M","consensus":"Only the most hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc.","rotten":10,"production":"Warner Independent Pictures","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-16T18:54:16Z"},"fresh":170},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDc5MDYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMzNDAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":{"$date":"2005-07-22T00:00:00Z"},"awards":{"wins":24,"nominations":12,"text":"Won 1 Oscar.

In the fall of 1986, at Ohio's Antioch College, Dresdner, Andrew Kessler, Steve Moriarty, and Zapata became The Gits. In 1989, they relocated to Seattle, WA, in search of a new life and a larger audience. The Gits quickly gained popularity in the Seattle music scene of the early 1990s, distinguishing themselves with their soulful street punk at a time when \"grunge\" was putting Seattle on the map. Characterized by powerful, driving music and Zapata's poetic lyrics, major record labels took notice. But just as The Gits were poised to explode onto the national music scene, an unfathomable tragedy struck. On July 7, 1993, Mia Zapata was raped and murdered in Seattle while walking home one night. Without warning, this promising band faced a horrific end and the fabric that built this tight knit music community began to unravel. In 2003, one year into filming \"The Gits\" documentary, a swab of saliva DNA left on Zapata's body solved the ten-year mystery which still haunted her friends, family, and fans since the day of her death so long ago. This film celebrates the band's enduring musical legacy while embracing the soul of the legendary Mia Zapata and the love that so many hold in their hearts for a band that continues to touch lives.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2008-07-07T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Kerri O'Kane"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":0,"text":"1 win."},"lastupdated":"2015-05-15 06:39:40.580000000","year":2005,"imdb":{"rating":8.1,"votes":245,"id":463028},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.0,"numReviews":316,"meter":86},"dvd":{"$date":"2008-07-08T00:00:00Z"},"website":"http://www.thegitsmovie.com/","production":"D&E Entertainment","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-06-20T18:16:04Z"}},"num_mflix_comments":0}

Idealistic Erin Gruwell is just starting her first teaching job, that as freshman and sophomore English teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School, which, two years earlier, implemented a voluntary integration program. For many of the existing teachers, the integration has ruined the school, whose previously stellar academic standing has been replaced with many students who will be lucky to graduate or even be literate. Despite choosing the school on purpose because of its integration program, Erin is unprepared for the nature of her classroom, whose students live by generations of strict moral codes of protecting their own at all cost. Many are in gangs and almost all know somebody that has been killed by gang violence. The Latinos hate the Cambodians who hate the blacks and so on. The only person the students hate more is Ms. Gruwell. It isn't until Erin holds an unsanctioned discussion about a recent drive-by shooting death that she fully begins to understand what she's up against. And it isn't until she provides an assignment of writing a daily journal - which will be not graded, and will remain unread by her unless they so choose - that the students begin to open up to her. As Erin tries harder and harder to have resources provided to teach properly (which often results in her needing to pay for them herself through working second and third jobs), she seems to face greater resistance, especially from her colleagues, such as Margaret Campbell, her section head, who lives by regulations and sees such resources as a waste, and Brian Gelford, who will protect his \"priviledged\" position of teaching the senior honors classes at all cost.

As Clark is white and \"nice\" looking, Principal Turner wants to assign him to the honors class, especially as Turner's job security depends on good test scores. Clark, however, wants to take the most disadvantaged class. He quickly learns that it will be a battle of wills between himself and his disruptive students to see who can outlast the other. But he also learns that he has to understand them, both individually and collectively, on their level to be able to get through to them before he can teach them the standardized materials. But even the best laid plans can be turned askew by unforeseen events, such as illness and the behavior of others outside of his control. And he has to overcome the self-fulfilling prophecy of failure to instill a sense of worth within the students.

Before he can act on his dream he becomes ill with a fever after tasting some sashimi made from shell fish, but an investigation reveals that the poisoning was not due to a human conspiracy, but a poor choice of food out of season. After three days he awakes but finds that the toxin from the food has blinded him. Kayo is summoned by Shinnojo's family to explain how the couple will survive. His uncle laments that he no longer knows anybody with influence in the castle, and asks Kayo if she knows of anybody. She relates how Toya Shimada, the chief duty officer in the castle and a samurai of high rank, offered to help and they tell her to act upon his offer of assistance. A message from the castle brings the good news that Shinnojo's stipend of rice will remain the same, and for life but his aunt tells him that Kayo was seen with another man. He has Tohuhei, his faithful servant, follow her. Kayo notices that she is being followed, and although Tokuhei offers to cover for her, she reveals to Shinnojo that Shimada offered to help but with a price, shown when he forced himself upon her. He then solicited two additional trysts by threatening to tell Shinnojo about the first. An enraged Shinnojo divorces her and orders her out of his house. When it is revealed to him that Shimada had nothing to do with maintaining his stipend, but that it came out of gratitude from the lord of the clan himself, Shinnojo seeks to renew his skill with the sword as a blind man to avenge the dishonor of Kayo. Through Tokuhei he sends a message to Shimada to set up a duel, with the additional message to not underestimate him.

He tells of his life at three primary points in his life: at age nine (when his parents divorced), age sixteen and age thirty-four. The confusing aspect of the story is that he tells of alternate life paths, often changing course with the flick of a decision at each of those ages. One life path has him ultimately married to Elise, a depressed woman who never got over the unrequited love she had for a guy named Stefano when she was a teenager and who asked Nemo to swear that when she died he would sprinkle her ashes on Mars. A second life path has him married to Jean. Their life is one of luxury but one also of utter boredom. And a third life path has him in a torrid romance with his step-sister Anna, the two who, as adults, would search for each other after having been torn apart as teenagers.

A line is crossed, an authority figure dies, and the pair must flee to Seoul. They soon take up with a trio of fellow minstrels and, lead by Jang-sang, present riskier shows that prove more lucrative; but, a scathing exhibition satirizing the king and his concubine puts them under arrest with a set date for execution. Forced to present themselves to the king for final judgment, they surprisingly wind up becoming his court performers, but the tyrannical king, though sensitive and intelligent, is also excessive and psychologically scarred, with the minstrel shows putting him uncomfortably in touch with buried issues over his dead mother (long ago forced to commit suicide by the court). This makes him dangerously unstable. The alarmed nobles, wanting the minstrels gone, find support from the king's mistress after the king's infatuation turns from her to Gong-gil. Longevity definitely isn't what it once was, and Jang-sang feels they all ought to high-tail it while they can, but Gong-gil, though unwaveringly allegiant, feels differently.","languages":["Korean"],"released":{"$date":"2005-12-29T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Joon-ik Lee"],"writers":["Seok-Hwan Choi","Tae-woong Kim (play)"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":0,"text":"1 win."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-14 23:58:16.170000000","year":2005,"imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":3521,"id":492835},"countries":["South Korea"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.0,"numReviews":5803,"meter":88},"production":"Pathfinder Home Entertainment","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-06T19:05:35Z"}},"num_mflix_comments":0}

His high-profile real estate acquisitions attract the attention of the local police force who have no qualms about using unprovoked brutality to bring him down. His trouble with the law, coupled with an escalating war between a local drug lord, creates a tense standoff: both sides are closing in, and Kunene must stay one step ahead--or his empire, and his life, will come crashing down.","imdb":{"rating":7.8,"votes":9474,"id":783532},"year":2008,"plot":"A young hoodlum's rise from a small-time criminal to a powerful crime entrepreneur during the turbulent years before and after the fall of apartheid.","genres":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"rated":"R","metacritic":53,"title":"Gangster's Paradise: Jerusalema","lastupdated":"2015-08-11 00:31:51.420000000","languages":["English","Afrikaans"],"writers":["Ralph Ziman"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.gangstersparadisejerusalema.com","viewer":{"rating":3.7,"numReviews":779,"meter":78},"dvd":{"$date":"2010-09-28T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":5.9,"numReviews":20,"meter":75},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-11T18:35:22Z"},"rotten":5,"production":"Anchor Bay Films","fresh":15},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5OTkyMzMzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczNDk0Mw@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":{"$date":"2008-08-29T00:00:00Z"},"awards":{"wins":6,"nominations":1,"text":"6 wins & 1 nomination."},"countries":["South Africa"],"cast":["Rapulana Seiphemo","Jeffrey Zekele","Ronnie Nyakale","Shelley Meskin"],"directors":["Ralph Ziman"],"runtime":119}

Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof lives hard, which includes heavy smoking, drinking, drug use (primarily cocaine) and casual sex. He is racist and homophobic. While in the hospital on a work related injury, the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+, and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. Ron is initially in angry denial that he would have a disease that only \"faggots\" have, but upon quick reflection comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He begins to read whatever research is available about the disease, which at this time seems to be most effectively treated by the drug AZT. AZT, however, is only in the clinical trials stage within the US. Incredulous that he, as a dying man, cannot pay for any drug which may save or at least prolong his life, he goes searching for it by whatever means possible. It eventually leads him to Mexico and a \"Dr.\" Vass, an American physician whose license was revoked in the US because of his AIDS related work against US regulations. Dr. Vass leads Ron to a cocktail of other drugs, some vitamins, he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms, since the virus, as Ron learns, will always be in the system of those who have been exposed to it. Ron begins to smuggle these drugs not approved by the FDA into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons. In this venture, he goes into an unlikely partnership with a HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon, who he met in the hospital and who has greater contact with AIDS patients through the gay community. As they try to work both above ground to get the meds to those that need them and underground to avoid detection by especially the FDA, Ron comes up with an idea to circumvent the fact of selling the drugs - which are not considered drugs yet since they are not FDA approved - directly to the HIV+ population, which then should should not be against the law. Richard Barkley and Dr. Sevard, the FDA's lead man on the file and one of Ron's doctors respectively, the latter who sees clinical trials as the only way to determine the efficacy of drugs despite the fact that Ron and others would have probably died already without these drugs, try to stop Ron and Rayon at every turn. Caught in the middle is Dr. Eve Saks, another of Ron's doctors, who understands why policies are place, but who can sympathize with Ron, Rayon and others - all her patients, directly or indirectly - in their situation.","languages":["English","Japanese"],"released":{"$date":"2013-11-22T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Jean-Marc Vallèe"],"writers":["Craig Borten","Melisa Wallack"],"awards":{"wins":93,"nominations":60,"text":"Won 3 Oscars.

After a 1969 marijuana arrest, Erickson entered an insanity plea and was sent to the Rusk State Hospital, a medieval institution deep in the east Texas pineforests. He remained there for three years with the state's most violent mentally ill offenders, then reemerged a changed man: He sang about ghouls, zombies, and Satan, christened himself \"the evil one,\" and declared himself an alien. At some point he stopped recording altogether and disappeared: \"the great lost vocalist of rock and roll.\" For the past 12 years, Erickson has lived as a total recluse, shut in with his white noise and watching cartoons all day. He collects junk-mail by the stack. He only opens the door for his mother, Evelyn. Evelyn spends her days in their crumbling family home, abandoned by her other four sons and husband, doing yoga and reimagining her life through homemade films and \"storyboards\"--large planks of cardboard onto which she's pasted family photos and written out the story of their lives, \"to convince myself that I'd been a good mother.\" Through them, she slowly charts the disintegration of their family. Her youngest son Sumner, the only family member to have escaped, has not returned home in ten years. He hears of his brother's situation and vows to persuade his mother to cede control of Roky in a \"crusade to give his brother his life and music back.\" Upon his arrival, Roky and Evelyn's insular world slowly unravels.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2005-03-15T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Keven McAlester"],"awards":{"wins":0,"nominations":1,"text":"1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-01 00:13:54.877000000","year":2005,"imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":767,"id":791268},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://youregonnamissme.com/","viewer":{"rating":3.5,"numReviews":8787,"meter":73},"dvd":{"$date":"2007-07-10T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":6.8,"numReviews":18,"meter":83},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-15T17:32:03Z"},"rotten":3,"production":"Palm Pictures","fresh":15}}

With his engaging and passionate approach to thinking, Zizek delves into the hidden language of cinema, uncovering what movies can tell us about ourselves. Whether he is untangling the famously baffling films of David Lynch, or overturning everything you thought you knew about Hitchcock, Zizek illuminates the screen with his passion, intellect, and unfailing sense of humour. THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA cuts its cloth from the very world of the movies it discusses; by shooting at original locations and from replica sets it creates the uncanny illusion that Zizek is speaking from 'within' the films themselves. Together the three parts construct a compelling dialectic of ideas. Described by The Times in London as 'the woman helming this Freudian inquest,' director Sophie Fiennes' collaboration with Slavoj Zizek illustrates the immediacy with which film and television can communicate complex ideas. Says Zizek: 'My big obsession is to make things clear. I can really explain a line of thought if I can somehow illustrate it in a scene from a film.

Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug's mother ran off and Doug's father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. But leaving is not as easy as he would like as he and the gang are tasked with a big job by a local gangster named Fergie whether Doug likes it or not. And Adam Frawley, the FBI's lead investigator, comes into evidence that links the foursome to the bank robbery and a subsequent armored car heist, so is on their tail for evidence that will send them away dead or alive.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2010-09-17T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Ben Affleck"],"writers":["Peter Craig (screenplay)","Ben Affleck (screenplay)","Aaron Stockard (screenplay)","Chuck Hogan (novel)"],"awards":{"wins":13,"nominations":41,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

What it turned into was a beautiful and dangerous life journey into the balance of life on earth. Driven by passion fed from a life-long fascination with sharks, Stewart debunks historical stereotypes and media depictions of sharks as bloodthirsty, man-eating monsters and reveals the reality of sharks as pillars in the evolution of the seas. Filmed in visually stunning, high definition video, Sharkwater takes you into the most shark rich waters of the world, exposing the exploitation and corruption surrounding the world's shark populations in the marine reserves of Cocos Island, Costa Rica and the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. In an effort to protect sharks, Stewart teams up with renegade conservationist Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Their unbelievable adventure together starts with a battle between the Sea Shepherd and shark poachers in Guatemala, resulting in pirate boat rammings, gunboat chases, mafia espionage, corrupt court systems and attempted murder charges, forcing them to flee for their lives. Through it all, Stewart discovers these magnificent creatures have gone from predator to prey, and how despite surviving the earth's history of mass extinctions, they could easily be wiped out within a few years due to human greed. Stewart's remarkable journey of courage and determination changes from a mission to save the world's sharks, into a fight for his life, and that of humankind.","imdb":{"rating":8.0,"votes":3949,"id":856008},"year":2006,"plot":"Sharkwater - The Story \"An eye-opening film...visually stunning... this movie will change the way you see our oceans.\" - Bonnie Laufer, Tribute Magazine For filmmaker Rob Stewart, exploring...","genres":["Documentary"],"rated":"PG","metacritic":59,"title":"Sharkwater","lastupdated":"2015-09-16 00:22:42.570000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Rob Stewart"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.sharkwater.com/","viewer":{"rating":4.2,"numReviews":4150,"meter":88},"dvd":{"$date":"2008-04-08T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":6.4,"numReviews":39,"meter":79},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-03T18:17:29Z"},"consensus":"In addition to its breathtaking underwater photography, Sharkwater has a convincing, impassioned argument of how the plight of sharks affects everyone.","rotten":8,"production":"Freestyle Releasing","fresh":31},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NjI2MDkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjcyNTE0MQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":{"$date":"2007-11-02T00:00:00Z"},"awards":{"wins":13,"nominations":3,"text":"13 wins & 3 nominations."},"countries":["Canada"],"cast":["Patrick Moore","Erich Ritter","Rob Stewart","Paul Watson"],"directors":["Rob Stewart"],"runtime":89}

But in summer 1977, the steely, cunning former commander-in-chief agreed to sit for one all-inclusive interview to confront the questions of his time in office and the Watergate scandal that ended his presidency. Nixon surprised everyone in selecting Frost as his televised confessor, intending to easily outfox the breezy British showman and secure a place in the hearts and minds of Americans (as well as a $600,000 fee). Likewise, Frost's team harbored doubts about their boss' ability to hold his own.

Mesmerized with trinkets of Earth's history and show tunes, WALL-E is alone on Earth except for a sprightly pet cockroach. One day, EVE, a sleek (and dangerous) reconnaissance robot, is sent to Earth to find proof that life is once again sustainable. WALL-E falls in love with EVE. WALL-E rescues EVE from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble. Consistent with her \"directive\", EVE takes the plant and automatically enters a deactivated state except for a blinking green beacon. WALL-E, doesn't understand what has happened to his new friend, but, true to his love, he protects her from wind, rain, and lightning, even as she is unresponsive. One day a massive ship comes to reclaim EVE, but WALL-E, out of love or loneliness, hitches a ride on the outside of the ship to rescue EVE. The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated Earth 700 years earlier. The people of Earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move.

When Los Angeles makes O'Malley an offer he can't refuse, an era comes to an end: in 1958 the Dodgers and cross-town-rival Giants go West, leaving the ghosts of Flatbush.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2007-07-11T00:00:00Z"},"writers":["Aaron Cohen","Charles Olivier"],"awards":{"wins":7,"nominations":0,"text":"7 wins."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-16 07:39:43.930000000","year":2007,"imdb":{"rating":8.2,"votes":213,"id":1059898},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":3.3,"numReviews":23,"meter":33},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2014-12-07T08:58:37Z"}}}

Takemura barely has his wits about him again when he runs across Fukuhara a second time, and this time the thug has a different proposal-a walk. That's right, in exchange for a million yen, Takemura must accompany Fukuhara on a walk across the city of Tokyo. Starting in a distant corner of the city, they begin their trek towards downtown, striking up a conversation. It's at this point that Fukuhara admits that he's recently killed his wife, and intends to turn himself in at Kasumagaseki police station-because, he says, it's the finest in town. The pair's itinerary, however, is hardly a quick and direct one. The disparate duo drift here and there, hanging out and coming across a host of eccentric personalities, creatures of the urban jungle's various habitats. As their walking, talking and trading truths continues, the arrangement between Takemura and Fukuhara starts to transform into friendship.","languages":["Japanese"],"released":{"$date":"2007-11-10T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Satoshi Miki"],"writers":["Yoshinaga Fujita (novel)","Satoshi Miki (screenplay)"],"awards":{"wins":4,"nominations":0,"text":"4 wins."},"lastupdated":"2015-07-08 09:32:26.673000000","year":2007,"imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":1555,"id":1098226},"countries":["Japan"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.0,"numReviews":552,"meter":87},"website":"http://tokyosanpo.jp/indexp.html","production":"Style Jam","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-22T18:18:04Z"}}}

Imagine that it needs no expensive technology, that it recycles its own waste, that it has its own power source. And now imagine that it can be built anywhere, by anyone, out of the things society throws away. Thirty years ago, architect Michael Reynolds imagined just such a home - then set out to build it. A visionary in the classic American mode, Reynolds has been fighting ever since to bring his concept to the public. He believes that in an age of ecological instability and impending natural disaster, his buildings can - and will - change the way we live. Shot over three years in the USA, India and Mexico, Garbage Warrior is a feature-length documentary film telling the epic story of maverick architect Michael Reynolds, his crew of renegade house builders from New Mexico, and their fight to introduce radically different ways of living. A snapshot of contemporary geo-politics and an inspirational tale of triumph over bureaucracy, Garbage Warrior is above all an intimate portrait of an extraordinary individual and his dream of changing the world.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2008-05-23T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Oliver Hodge"],"awards":{"wins":2,"nominations":4,"text":"2 wins & 4 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-09 00:03:56.740000000","year":2007,"imdb":{"rating":7.8,"votes":624,"id":1104694},"countries":["UK"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.garbagewarrior.com/","viewer":{"rating":4.1,"numReviews":525,"meter":86},"dvd":{"$date":"2008-11-11T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":6.6,"numReviews":5,"meter":80},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-01T18:03:02Z"},"rotten":1,"fresh":4},"num_mflix_comments":0}

These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug's mother ran off and Doug's father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. But leaving is not as easy as he would like as he and the gang are tasked with a big job by a local gangster named Fergie whether Doug likes it or not. And Adam Frawley, the FBI's lead investigator, comes into evidence that links the foursome to the bank robbery and a subsequent armored car heist, so is on their tail for evidence that will send them away dead or alive.","imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":261519,"id":840361},"year":2010,"plot":"As he plans his next job, a longtime thief tries to balance his feelings for a bank manager connected to one of his earlier heists, as well as the FBI agent looking to bring him and his crew down.","genres":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"rated":"R","metacritic":74,"title":"The Town","lastupdated":"2015-09-07 01:52:56.743000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Peter Craig (screenplay)","Ben Affleck (screenplay)","Aaron Stockard (screenplay)","Chuck Hogan (novel)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.thetownmovie.com/","viewer":{"rating":3.9,"numReviews":138859,"meter":85},"dvd":{"$date":"2010-12-17T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.7,"numReviews":214,"meter":93},"boxOffice":"$92.2M","consensus":"Tense, smartly written, and wonderfully cast, The Town proves that Ben Affleck has rediscovered his muse -- and that he's a director to be reckoned with.","rotten":14,"production":"Warner Bros.

The production of food overall has more drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations, the global food production business - with an emphasis on the business - has as its unwritten goals production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often subsidized) resulting in enormous profits, which in turn results in greater control of the global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety (of the food itself, of the animals produced themselves, of the workers on the assembly lines, and of the consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked by the companies, and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these negative consequences. Many of the changes are based on advancements in science and technology, but often have negative side effects.The products made have been shown in several studies to enlarge male sexual organs and increase male breast size. The answer that the companies have come up with is to throw more science at the problems to bandage the issues but not the root causes.

Despite the department already having two other suspects, Benjamèn and Pablo ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gèmez is the real killer. Although he is aware that historical accuracy is not paramount for the novel, the process of revisiting the case is more an issue of closure for him. He tries to speak to the key players in the case, most specifically Irene, who still works in the justice department and who he has always been attracted to but never pursued due to the differences in their ages and social classes. The other issue is that Gèmez is still at large, no one aware if he is alive or dead.

{"_id":{"$oid":"573a13c3f29313caabd6a72b"},"fullplot":"Richard O'Barry was the man who captured and trained the dolphins for the television show Flipper (1964). O'Barry's view of cetaceans in captivity changed from that experience when as the last straw he saw that one of the dolphins playing Flipper - her name being Kathy - basically committed suicide in his arms because of the stress of being in captivity. Since that time, he has become one of the leading advocates against cetaceans in captivity and for the preservation of cetaceans in the wild. O'Barry and filmmaker 'Louie Psihoyos (I)' go about trying to expose one of what they see as the most cruel acts against wild dolphins in the world in Taiji, Japan, where dolphins are routinely corralled, either to be sold alive to aquariums and marine parks, or slaughtered for meat. The primary secluded cove where this activity is taking place is heavily guarded.

In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg shook America to its foundations when he smuggled a top-secret Pentagon study to the New York Times that showed how five Presidents consistently lied to the American people about the Vietnam War that was killing millions and tearing America apart. President Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger called Ellsberg \"the most dangerous man in America,\" who \"had to be stopped at all costs.\" But Ellsberg wasn't stopped. Facing 115 years in prison on espionage and conspiracy charges, he fought back. Ensuing events surrounding the so-called Pentagon Papers led directly to Watergate and the downfall of President Nixon, and hastened the end of the Vietnam War. Ellsberg's relentless telling of truth to power, which exposed the secret deeds of an \"Imperial Presidency,\" inspired Americans of all walks of life to forever question the previously-unchallenged pronouncements of its leaders. \"The Most Dangerous Man in America\" tells the inside story, for the first time on film, of this pivotal event that changed history and transformed our nation's political discourse. It is told largely by the players of that dramatic episode-Ellsberg, his colleagues, family and critics; Pentagon Papers authors and government officials; Vietnam veterans and anti-war activists; Watergate principals, attorneys and the journalists who both covered the story and were an integral part of it; and finally-through White House audiotapes-President Nixon and his inner circle of advisors.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2009-10-17T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Judith Ehrlich","Rick Goldsmith"],"writers":["Lawrence Lerew","Rick Goldsmith","Judith Ehrlich","Michael Chandler"],"awards":{"wins":6,"nominations":2,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

MINE explores how tragedy intensifies that bond and is told from the perspective of original guardians, rescuers, and adoptive parents of the voiceless victims of Katrina. These individuals are all connected by two things, the tragic aftermath of Katrina and their love of animals. In response to an unprecedented crisis, thousands of pets needed to be transported around the country and adopted even when their displaced guardians still desperately wanted them. Meanwhile, many adoptive guardians have forged strong bonds with their new pets, nurturing them back to health from the traumas they suffered during and after the storm. When two families love the same pet, conflicts inevitably arise over who is the rightful \"owner\" and what is right for the animal. At the center of this tension are pets who are loved like family, but by law are considered property. This begs the question, who is looking out for the best interest of the animals? Set in a post-Katrina landscape of poverty, loss and moral uncertainty, MINE presents the complexity of an intensely emotional situation that has no simple answers. A tragedy of this scale reveals the worst and brings out the best in humankind and presents an opportunity for us to bring about meaningful social change. MINE is a compelling, character-driven story that challenges us see the way we treat animals in our society as a reflection of how we treat ourselves - and each other.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Geralyn Pezanoski"],"writers":["Erin Essenmacher","Geralyn Pezanoski (creator)"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":1,"text":"1 win & 1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-16 00:24:35.213000000","year":2009,"imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":227,"id":1326247},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://minethemovie.com/","viewer":{"rating":4.0,"numReviews":245,"meter":89},"dvd":{"$date":"2010-05-04T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":6.7,"numReviews":15,"meter":80},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-01T19:32:52Z"},"rotten":3,"production":"Film Movement","fresh":12}}

In fact, many of our best intentions have actually undermined the communities they aimed to benefit. GOOD FORTUNE presents a unique opportunity to experience foreign aid through the lens of the people it is intended to help. Shot over three years across Kenya's diverse landscapes, the film interweaves intimate portraits of three individuals targeted by massive international development projects. Jackson, Silva, and Okech fight against the odds as they confront the development projects that are threatening to destroy their homes and livelihoods. In the rural countryside, Jackson's farm is being flooded by an American investor who hopes to alleviate poverty by creating a multi-million dollar rice farm. On neighboring Lake Victoria, Oketch battles World Bank environmental policies that are making it nearly impossible for him to survive as a fisherman. And in Nairobi, Silva's home and business in Africa's largest squatter community are being demolished as part of a United Nations slum-upgrading project. Interweaving meditative portraits of its characters, GOOD FORTUNE examines the impact of international aid on the ground, according to those it is intended to benefit. With a broad scope and intimate style, the film portrays surprising stories of human perseverance and suggests that the answers for Africa lie in the resilience of its people.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2009-06-01T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Landon Van Soest"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":0,"text":"1 win."},"lastupdated":"2015-03-07 02:59:46.073000000","year":2009,"imdb":{"rating":7.8,"votes":32,"id":1337048},"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":3.2,"numReviews":27,"meter":50},"dvd":{"$date":"2010-09-14T00:00:00Z"},"production":"Transient Pictures","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-07-06T18:08:19Z"}}}

To escape the harsh reality of their world, its people seek refuge in the fantastical world of cinema. This passion for cinema has spurred a group of cinema enthusiasts to make their own films-quirky, low budget, socially aware and notoriously funny spoofs of Bollywood films. Their ambition has grown and now they are ready to take on Hollywood and Superman. We follow them on this journey. At times funny, tragic, contemplative. Always warm and engaging. And as the film begins to take shape, through schemes and approaches that are sublimely ingenious, simply bizarre and purely hysterical, we also slowly discover Malegaon itself. A microcosm that embodies and reflects the complexities of modern small town India. Where the modern and the traditional rub shoulders, where extreme poverty and extreme wealth are neighbours, bewildering in its diversity, trapped in self-made destinies, with a spirit that can never be vanquished. The film is a tribute to that spirit, the spirit that enables The Supermen of Malegaon to make Malegaon's Superman.","languages":["Urdu","Hindi"],"released":{"$date":"2009-06-16T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Faiza Ahmad Khan"],"awards":{"wins":6,"nominations":1,"text":"6 wins & 1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-07-25 00:21:22.147000000","year":2008,"imdb":{"rating":8.0,"votes":445,"id":1479380},"countries":["Singapore","Japan","South Korea","India"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":0.0,"numReviews":0},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-17T19:18:19Z"}}}

Facing impossible odds, the men fought 78 miles to freedom and saved the lives of 98,000 civilian refugees. Chosin is the first-ever documentary on the Chosin Reservoir Campaign. Presented in full, immersive HD, the stories of our veterans are supplemented with rare black and white and color archival footage gathered from hundreds of hours of research. After 60 years of silence, the survivors of the campaign take us on an emotional and heart-pounding journey through one of the most savage battles in American history. These first-hand accounts, combined with footage never before seen by most Americans, create a visceral, emotionally charged experience unlike that provided by any other war documentary. As a fellow combat veteran, director Brian Iglesias forged a unique connection with the men he interviewed. Time and time again, these men shared stories that they have never told to anyone...not their wives, their children, or their closest friends.

Traveling with a young team of adventurers by helicopter, canoe and dog sled across three continents, Balog risks his career and his well-being in pursuit of the biggest story in human history. As the debate polarizes America and the intensity of natural disasters ramp up around the world, 'Chasing Ice' depicts a heroic photojournalist on a mission to gather evidence and deliver hope to our carbon-powered planet","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2012-12-14T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Jeff Orlowski"],"writers":["Mark Monroe"],"awards":{"wins":10,"nominations":3,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

To support his extravagant lifestyle, he is also an art thief, which he does in cahoots with his friend, the gun toting Ove Kjikerud. They replace the originals with forgeries, which go undetected at least until the trail back to them goes cold. His outward bravado, based primarily on building upon reputation, masks his insecurities, especially in his short physical stature. He feels he needs that confident demeanor and wealth to get what he wants, including his trophy wife, art gallery owner Diana Brown. However, he almost seems to like the thought of what Diana represents more than Diana herself. As such, he has a mistress on the side named Lotte. The issue of having a baby - Diana wants to get pregnant while Roger doesn't want her to - is another bone of contention in their marriage. The two sides of Roger's professional life intersect when Diana introduces him to Clas Greve, who would be perfect for the CEO position at Pathfinder, the job for which Roger is currently recruiting. Clas is also in possession of a priceless Rubens, which if Roger and Ove can steal it, would be by far their most lucrative theft to date. After he and Ove are able to steal the painting, things start going wrong for Roger. He learns that Diana is having an affair with Clas. And someone is trying to kill him. He learns that it is Clas, who seems to know his every move. Is Clas trying to kill him for Diana? Or because he knows about the theft? Or a combination of the two? Or is there a bigger picture which Roger will have to discover?","languages":["Norwegian","Danish","Russian","English"],"released":{"$date":"2011-08-26T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Morten Tyldum"],"writers":["Ulf Ryberg (screenplay)","Lars Gudmestad (screenplay)","Jo Nesbè (novel)"],"awards":{"wins":8,"nominations":7,"text":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Film Award.

Joèo Canijo's latest feature portrays life in this decrepit Portuguese suburb through the story of a family attempting to transcend its hardships. Mèrcia (Rita Blanco) shares cramped quarters with her two young-adult children and her sister Ivete. Her daughter Clèudia shows promise in her nursing studies, but her son Joca (Rafael Morais) is a delinquent with a suspicious supply of cash. Mèrcia's hopes for her daughter's future are thrown into turmoil, however, when Clèudia announces she's having a relationship with a married professor, an admission that brings out the specter of Mèrcia's own past. Mèrcia is determined to bring the affair to an end, even if it means compromising her cherished relationship with Clèudia. In her late thirties and yearning for companionship, Ivete loves her family and has a soft spot for her nephew Joca, despite his frequent brushes with the law. When a notorious drug dealer discovers Joca has tried to cheat him, the latter turns to Ivete, the only person who will bail him out. The fallout from the incident has perilous consequences for them both. Canijo spent over two years rehearsing with the actors, and the result is a masterful piece that speaks deeply about unconditional love. Despite the difficulties against which the characters struggle for the benefit of their loved ones, Canijo's skillful cinematic treatment brings a message of hope and renewal as well as sacrifice.","languages":["Portuguese"],"released":{"$date":"2011-10-05T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Joèo Canijo"],"writers":["Joèo Canijo"],"awards":{"wins":17,"nominations":9,"text":"17 wins & 9 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-12 00:01:34.953000000","year":2011,"imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":1298,"id":1625155},"countries":["Portugal"],"type":"movie"}

Thanks to the production teams of Intermedia Network, the epoch comes to life and at times we feel hypnotized by the magic of the cobblestone streets of Cubura, audiences sense the hype of using electricity, birth of the radio and the growing trend of cabaret nightclubs and Ford T model cars just like the one owned by then soccer star, Blagoje Mosa Marjanovic (Petar Strugar). This show introduces us to a whole new generation of young actors (Milos Bikovic, Viktor Savic, Aleksandar Radojicic, Nenad Herakovic, Uros Jovcic, Nenad Herakovic, Milan Nikitovic, Rade Cosic, Bojan Krivokapic and Aleksandar Filimonovic) who play the roles of almost forgotten historical figures, soccer gods, players of the then most popular and valiant clubs, BSK and Yugoslavia and a very extraordinary goalie from the less recognized Soko Club (Andrija Kuzmanovic). Other roles were cast out to the very best of Serbian cinematography such as Srdjan Todorovic, Slobodan Boda Ninkovic, Nikola Djuricko, Vojin Cetkovic, Branimir Brstina, Mima Karadzic, Marko Zivic, Sergej Trifunovic, Marko Nikolic, Anita Mancic, Branka Pujic and others, just to name a few. The subject of soccer seems to take lead but very soon we see that love, heroism, companionship, faith, honor, patriotism and respect are actually the main characters. Throughout the episodes, the inhabitants of Belgrade are introduced to us via their individual and almost quirky personalities, aspirations and head-strong ambitions, innovations that were then considered to be ludicrous and the constantly present ideal of an almost impossible trip to the first FIFA World Cup in a place that seems to be at the end of the globe, far away Montevideo, Uruguay.","languages":["Serbian","Bulgarian","French"],"released":{"$date":"2010-12-20T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Dragan Bjelogrlic"],"writers":["Ranko Bozic","Srdjan Dragojevic","Vladimir Stankovic (novel)"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":2,"text":"1 win & 2 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-27 00:23:43.870000000","year":2010,"imdb":{"rating":8.4,"votes":8562,"id":1634013},"countries":["Serbia"],"type":"movie"}

As in life, when everyone sees themselves as the center of their own drama, heroes of \"Chapiteau\" are heroes in their own story, while in other people's stories they are sometimes hardly visible characters.

Love, Friendship, Respect, Cooperation - colors in which the life, its walls are painted. Going from one strip to another we often do not notice that we run in circles, we live the same situations, we say the same words.

The production of food overall has more drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations, the global food production business - with an emphasis on the business - has as its unwritten goals production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often subsidized) resulting in enormous profits, which in turn results in greater control of the global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety (of the food itself, of the animals produced themselves, of the workers on the assembly lines, and of the consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked by the companies, and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these negative consequences. Many of the changes are based on advancements in science and technology, but often have negative side effects.The products made have been shown in several studies to enlarge male sexual organs and increase male breast size. The answer that the companies have come up with is to throw more science at the problems to bandage the issues but not the root causes. The global food supply may be in crisis with lack of biodiversity, but can be changed on the demand side of the equation.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Robert Kenner"],"writers":["Robert Kenner","Elise Pearlstein","Kim Roberts"],"awards":{"wins":8,"nominations":18,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

To make matters worse, lions, unlike elephants, which are far more numerous, have virtually no protection under government mandate or through international accords.

Pointing to poaching as a primary threat while noting the lion's pride of place on the list for eco-tourists-an industry that brings in 200 billion dollars per year worldwide-the Jouberts build a solid case for both the moral duty we have to protect lions (as well as other threatened \"big cats,\" tigers among them) and the economic sense such protection would make.

If there's a dollar to be made, he doesn't leave the bathroom. And if Shoes doesn't leave, neither does the viewer. Through years of meticulous journaling, Griffith secretly recorded hours of conversations with customers. The result is a fascinating exploration of the host/parasite relationships that are cultivated in this underbelly of Broadway. With disarming authenticity, Griffith uncovers glimpses of wisdom in the unlikeliest of characters.

Told through the personal accounts of trafficked women, undercover footage, and still photography, this documentary exposes the root causes of why women continue to be sold into prostitution against their will and examines what can be done to stop it.","languages":["English","Turkish","Romanian"],"released":{"$date":"2011-04-09T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Mimi Chakarova"],"awards":{"wins":0,"nominations":2,"text":"2 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-07-04 00:02:54.667000000","year":2011,"imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":104,"id":1734163},"countries":["USA","United Arab Emirates","Bulgaria","Moldova","Turkey"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":0.0,"numReviews":0},"website":"http://www.neasahardiman.com/","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-01-04T23:43:01Z"}}}

Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore, the Two Ronnies, French and Saunders... the list goes on. Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are now known as two of the world's most popular figures in entertainment, enjoying solo success (in Stephen's case) writing, performing and broadcasting, and (in Hugh's case) award-winning US drama. But it's easy for a new generation of comedy fans to forget that at the start of their careers they worked together as one of the nation's most popular comedy double acts. This UK premiere celebrates the 30th anniversary of the pair working together. Back in 1980, Fry and Laurie met for the first time at Cambridge University, introduced by their mutual friend Emma Thompson, and quickly became the torchbearers for the established Footlights comedy and performing troupe. They were the perfect combination - Stephen was tall, awkward and an expert straight man, while Hugh was a physical comedy whirlwind. They found themselves at the forefront of the new alternative comedy movement in the early 1980s and reaped the benefits, finding fertile ground in which to showcase their talents - they won the inaugural Perrier Award at the Edinburgh festival in 1981, they frequently appeared in the ground breaking Saturday Night Live, they starred together in Blackadder, and their own series, A Bit Of Fry And Laurie, ran from 1989 to 1995. Now, in Fry And Laurie Reunited, the pair talk exclusively about their friendship, their personalities and talk through some of their favourite sketches. With plenty of clips and rare material, this is the ultimate celebration of two of Britain's favourite sons.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2010-11-24T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Mike Reilly"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":0,"text":"1 win."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-14 01:11:44.397000000","year":2010,"imdb":{"rating":7.9,"votes":97,"id":1786488},"countries":["UK"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.3,"numReviews":26,"meter":82},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-06-21T18:30:48Z"}}}

Shortly after, the first worldwide cartel was set up expressly to reduce the life span of the incandescent light bulb, a symbol for innovation and bright new ideas, and the first official victim of Planned Obsolescence. During the 1950s, with the birth of the consumer society, the concept took on a whole new meaning, as explained by flamboyant designer Brooks Stevens: 'Planned Obsolescence, the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary...'. The growth society flourished, everybody had everything, the waste was piling up (preferably far away in illegal dumps in the Third World) - until consumers started rebelling...

Far Out Isn't Far Enough explores the circumstances of his meteoric rise and fall on American soil, but also delves into Ungerer's formative years leading up to, and prolific years since, his time in America.","languages":["English","French"],"released":{"$date":"2012-12-19T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Brad Bernstein"],"writers":["Brad Bernstein"],"awards":{"wins":6,"nominations":3,"text":"6 wins & 3 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-12 00:32:26.123000000","year":2012,"imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":246,"id":1974254},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.faroutthemovie.com/","viewer":{"rating":4.2,"numReviews":368,"meter":90},"dvd":{"$date":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.3,"numReviews":23,"meter":91},"boxOffice":"$33.4k","rotten":2,"production":"First Run Features","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-14T19:19:21Z"},"fresh":21}}

Winner of the Grammy for Lifetime Achievement and member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, Glen was the first country music star to cross over to the pop charts, opening a new realm of opportunity for generations of country musicians. In 2011, when Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, he joined forces with his family to fight the biggest battle of his life. Glen and his wife, Kim, made history by going public with the diagnosis - the first time a major American celebrity would share this experience with the world. The Campbell family then embarked on a short \"Goodbye Tour,\" but the three-week engagement turned into an emotional and triumphant 151-show nationwide tour de force. This epic human drama about the undying bond between Glen and Kim, and their unwavering caring for each other, chronicles a story of love, resilience and the power of song.

This resistance sprang to life without almost any outside support in 1940 and again in 1944, continuing in various forms, armed and unarmed, until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. This is the story of one of the twentieth centuries most significant anti-soviet resistance movements, told through the words and experiences of one of its leaders, Juozas Luksa and his fellow Forest Brothers. The documentary seeks to provide an understanding of the dynamics of the armed and unarmed underground resistance through interviews and first time access to never been seen before archival footage. Its a ground breaking film of a dying heritage. We have conducted over 50 on camera interviews, including dignitaries such President Adamkus of Lithuania and President Zatlers of Latvia, CIA operatives and US government officials, as well as the many specific individuals of Baltic Nations who fought not only against Stalin and his regime, but also those who fought for Moscow. The story seeks to understand both sides of this war, a war which ultimately contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, 50 years after its spark. It puts the question about the personal choice in times of hardship and repression. The dedicated team comprised Mark Ryan, Mark Johnston, Jonas Ohman, and Vincas Sruoginis have spent the past 4 years on production on location in New York, Washington DC, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania uncovering stories and facts that will provide for the first time an accurate account of this traumatic post-war struggle in Eastern Europe following World War II. Through reenactments, archival footage provided by LTV and the National Archives in Washington DC, interviews of the actual participants, first time access by the KGB museum to film the actual documents and photos of the era, and with the voice Jouzas Luksa narrated by Andrius Mamantovas we hope to convey the story of the Lithuanian underground armed resistance and its tragedy. Many people interviewed in this documentary had either a prominent front row seat in, or actually participated in, the underground resistance and are the few to have lived to see the fall of the Soviet Union. Their view-points have been constructed to portray a western understanding of this major historical event.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2014-11-07T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Jonas Ohman","Vincas Sruoginis"],"writers":["Mark Johnston","Jonas Ohman","Vincas Sruoginis"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":2,"text":"1 win & 2 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-07-29 00:10:47.707000000","year":2014,"imdb":{"rating":8.1,"votes":398,"id":2073679},"countries":["Russia","USA","Latvia","Estonia","Lithuania"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.theinvisiblefront.com/","viewer":{"rating":4.7,"numReviews":45,"meter":100},"critic":{"rating":7.5,"numReviews":7,"meter":100},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-04T19:38:50Z"},"rotten":0,"production":"Forest Brothers LLC.","fresh":7}}

Despite being abandoned as a child, a period of homelessness, the devastating loss of his brother and constant poverty, Charles never gave up on his life long dream to be a professional singer. With the help of producer and Grammy-winner Gabriel Roth (Daptone Records) and musician Tommy Brenneck, Charles moved away from the James Brown covers he'd been performing for nearly half a century and focused on finding his own unique voice. Earning himself an opening spot on tour for Sharon Jones, the biggest artist in the Daptone stable, Charles delivered the most impassioned performances of his life. Coming up during one of the worst economic downturns in history, Charles' heartfelt songs about tragedy, the downfall of the American dream, and hope for a better world resonated with audiences and the future he'd been chasing for 48 years was starting to become a reality. But, while experiencing his first taste of success, Charles couldn't escape the adversity that had followed him since birth. When the oppressive mortgage on his 87-year-old mother's house threatened to cost him everything, Charles hit a new low. And then, following his sold out album release, Charles' life changed completely. Championed by critics and fans alike, \"No Time For Dreaming\" became one of the best-selling independent records of the year, landing on Rolling Stone magazine's top 50 albums of 2011 and securing Charles coveted spots on late night shows with Jay Leno and Carson Daly. Scoring more than 1.5 million views online, his music video was quickly snatched up by VH1 and bookings began pouring in. In the time since his incredible debut, Charles' star has continued to rise. He tours the world almost year-round to growing crowds, pouring his soul out at each show as if it's his last and stepping off stage to give out teary-eyed hugs and acknowledge the miracle of the journey that Spin calls \"...utterly amazing.\"","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2012-03-09T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Poull Brien"],"awards":{"wins":0,"nominations":2,"text":"2 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-28 00:07:41.423000000","year":2012,"imdb":{"rating":7.6,"votes":428,"id":2125467},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.1,"numReviews":73},"website":"http://www.charlesbradleyfilm.com/","production":"Sum Of Us","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-11T18:26:53Z"}}}

He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["John Lee Hancock"],"writers":["Kelly Marcel","Sue Smith"],"awards":{"wins":12,"nominations":71,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Child's Pose is based on the sense of loss of parents who have to send their children away-physically and psychologically. The parent-child relationship is re-assessed through a son in his 30s that wants to escape from his mother, who in turn wants to keep her adult son by her side. The mother's character is quite familiar, but this film is unique in that the director delicately portrays how the controlling mother wants to deny that her son is destined to leave her by following the characters' emotional flows and gazing at their twisted desires. Luminita Gheorghiu turns in an extraordinary performance in playing a mother struggling to \"save\" her son. Heading to the conclusion, the film shows that the unhealthy mother-son relationship is not that simple when it comes to matters of humane duty.","languages":["Romanian"],"released":{"$date":"2013-03-08T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Calin Peter Netzer"],"writers":["Razvan Radulescu (screenplay)","Calin Peter Netzer (screenplay)"],"awards":{"wins":14,"nominations":4,"text":"14 wins & 4 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-14 08:05:58.500000000","year":2013,"imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":5456,"id":2187115},"countries":["Romania"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/film.php?directoryname=childspose&mode=downloads","viewer":{"rating":3.7,"numReviews":1795,"meter":76},"critic":{"rating":7.6,"numReviews":74,"meter":93},"boxOffice":"$94.9k","consensus":"It isn't necessarily an easy watch, but thanks to Netzer's interesting direction and a riveting performance from Gheorghiu, Child's Pose is rewarding.","rotten":5,"production":"Zeitgeist Films","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-23T18:33:37Z"},"fresh":69},"num_mflix_comments":0}

The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road.

Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving.

A decade after that humiliating night, they remain rooted to the bottom of FIFA's World rankings, having scored only twice in seventeen years. They have lost every competitive game they have ever played. Against this backdrop of serial underachievement, the team face the daunting prospect of a qualification campaign for the upcoming 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It would take a miracle-maker or a madman to turn the team's fortunes around - and in maverick Dutch coach Thomas Rongen the islanders somehow find both. As a loan appointment from the mighty U.S. Soccer Federation, with experience of playing alongside football greats like George Best and Johann Cruyff, Rongen is completely unprepared for what greets him on the island - in his own words it is \"by far the lowest standard\" of football he's ever seen, with only half of his team even fit enough to play a whole game. A lack of athleticism aside, Rongen's ailing squad contains the emotionally scarred goalkeeper who conceded 31 goals against Australia a decade earlier and a member of Samoa's third gender, the fa'fafine, who lives 24/7 as a woman. To complicate matters further the team's best player has been posted 6000 miles away by the US military. With the team about to embark on a grueling World Cup Qualification campaign, Rongen has just one month to transform this ragtag of losers into a winning team - and perhaps learn a little about himself along the way.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2014-05-09T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Mike Brett","Steve Jamison"],"awards":{"wins":2,"nominations":2,"text":"2 wins & 2 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-16 11:48:41.577000000","year":2014,"imdb":{"rating":7.9,"votes":1400,"id":2446600},"countries":["UK"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://nextgoalwinsmovie.com/","viewer":{"rating":4.2,"numReviews":617,"meter":87},"dvd":{"$date":"2014-07-22T00:00:00Z"},"critic":{"rating":7.6,"numReviews":29,"meter":100},"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-16T17:45:12Z"},"rotten":0,"production":"Ketchup Entertainment","fresh":29}}

Then Latvia is overrun with invasions by the Soviets, then the Nazis, then the Soviets once again. Anna is a pillar of strength, defying the hardships, raising her young, teaching them survival secrets of the forest. But something inside her is terribly wrong. Years later, Signe, a young artist, asks her father, \"how did my grandmother die?\" Her father is evasive. His seven siblings are evasive, as well. Signe strongly suspects that Anna committed suicide. Clues of mental illness had always leaked through the family stories. Signe suffers from depression herself. Her suicidal fantasies get her locked away for four months in a Soviet mental institute. Three of her cousins, all women, battle madness, as well.

He assumed he'd be coaching a 16-and-under team of seasoned and accomplished competitors, but instead is saddled with a 10-and-under team of inexperienced players. Not only is he forced to go back to the basics and teach the fundamentals of the game to the little girls, half of whom would rather be in the dugout eating snacks, but he also faces the greater challenge of riding herd over their over-eager, overly ambitious, and entirely delusional parents whose ridiculous behavior is more suited to five-year-olds than adults. Lance also faces a personal decision about whether it's more important to win at all costs or to teach the girls something their parents seem to have forgotten: that each player is a valuable member of the team and fair play is more important than winning. Even though he knows what the answer should be, Lance's moral compass is severely tested by the relentless take-no-prisoners mentality of the parents as well as his own ambitions and innate drive to win. He may be dealing with eight, nine, and ten-year-old little girls, but he is, after all, only human. Meanwhile, each parent is on a mission to ensure that their nine-year-old prodigy is recognized as the elite athlete they imagine her to be, whether or not she possesses one whit of actual athletic ability. The parents' blind ambitions, combined with their grand delusions, give each parent the baseless notion that the Holy Grail - an All-Star jacket with their child's name on the back - is not only within reach, but is her God-given-birthright. \"All-Stars\" provides a hilarious commentary on the state of all youth sports today, fueled by the outrageous behavior of the desperate sports parent living vicariously through his or her child. In the vein of a Christopher Guest film - think \"Best in Show\" where it's more about the dog owners than the dogs - \"All-Stars\" is about the adults involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires, volunteers, board members, etc.) more than the kids.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2014-10-15T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Lance Kinsey"],"writers":["Lance Kinsey","Lance Kinsey"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":1,"text":"1 win & 1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-02 00:22:19.287000000","year":2014,"imdb":{"rating":8.4,"votes":73,"id":3113448},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":0.0,"numReviews":0},"website":"http://https://www.facebook.com/TheMendozaLine","production":"Prospect Films","lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-09-10T19:27:05Z"}},"num_mflix_comments":0}

Unexpected circumstances ensue, and Chuan reluctantly submits to their union, on the condition that their wedding adheres to Chinese tradition. Part of that tradition is that Chuan must invite all of his childhood friends personally.

Set in the south, it's a road movie, a buddy picture and an often sweet, thought-provoking story of redemption. Dragged from one religious experience to another by his mother Catherine in an attempt to fulfill her own spiritual quest, Jack Harriman finds that he knows more about the world's vast religions than most scholars. Living a simple life and using his religious expertise to attract women, Jack is asked to join a local cable access television show called Divine Access, produced by his good friend Bob McCord. Bob is keenly aware of Jack's penchant for discrediting religious zealots like the current host of the show, Reverend Guy Roy Davis. Jack humiliates Reverend Davis on an episode that quickly goes viral. Jack's immediate popularity fuels a jealousy and hatred within Guy Roy sending him on a downward spiral from grace. Jack, on the other hand, becomes a spiritual celebrity and reluctantly takes to the road on a multi-city speaking tour. Along for the ride is Nigel, a self proclaimed \"catcher\" who earned his nickname for catching those overcome with the spirit while on the religious circuit. Jack and Nigel are joined by Amber, a down on her luck call-girl who Jack takes under his wing, and Marian, an enigmatic beauty who challenges Jack's beliefs and questions whether he has some deeper calling. When Jack realizes he has become a false prophet, the thing he despises most, forces both natural and supernatural lead him on a journey to discover his own spiritual truth, culminating in a final showdown with Guy Roy Davis. Surrounded by those he loves and those who love him, Jack's story will forever change the lives of the throngs of fans that have come to hear him speak. Ultimately, DIVINE ACCESS is a story of family, friendship and faith.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2015-04-11T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Steven Chester Prince"],"writers":["John A.

Obsessed with the edges of society, dirty language spoken as poems and occasional nudity, Giuseppe's films may resemble the underground worlds of Harmony Korine, John Waters and Tod Browning. With a handwritten script, a video camera, an acting ensemble of neighbors and homeless friends - and almost no money, Giuseppe has now made 30 feature films. In Giuseppe's new film \"Garbanzo Gas\", Vietnam Ron, one of many homeless men in Ventura that Giuseppe has grown up with, plays a vegan cow on vacation from the slaughterhouse. The doc GIUSEPPE MAKES A MOVIE follows the making of \"Garbanzo Gas.\" From Giuseppe's headquarters - his own mobile home - we follow as he sets out to make a feature film in just two days. The stranger-than-fiction documentary explores the Giuseppe universe, showing how the self-taught filmmaker captures an unexpected level of humanism and creates a family unit for a group of people who needed one.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2015-01-15T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Adam Rifkin"],"writers":["David Nordstrom","Mike Plante","Adam Rifkin"],"awards":{"wins":0,"nominations":1,"text":"1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-17 02:39:03.027000000","year":2014,"imdb":{"rating":8.2,"votes":63,"id":3661072},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie"}

The first responders included an armed businessman named Abdul Haji and several other plain-clothed cops who made the ultimate call not to wait for reinforcements but instead stormed into the Westgate mall with the aim of saving lives. We follow the heart-wrenching stories of the lucky survivors of this terrorist attack as they narrate the accounts of that Saturday afternoon. Some of them include women and children who lived to tell their stories. HBO also gives us the accounts of the first responders as we observe their performance thanks to the CCTV surveillance systems which the terror gang left intact.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2014-09-15T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Dan Reed"],"awards":{"wins":0,"nominations":1,"text":"1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-14 00:47:25.020000000","year":2014,"imdb":{"rating":8.2,"votes":359,"id":4007554},"type":"movie","num_mflix_comments":0}

It also revisits Duffy's turbulent childhood -- How a teacher recognized talent in a troubled teenager, how an unimaginable family tragedy made Duffy seek refuge in the kitchen, and how cooking ultimately exacted a price.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2015-03-13T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Mark Helenowski","Kevin Pang"],"awards":{"wins":0,"nominations":1,"text":"1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-16 07:18:28.547000000","year":2015,"imdb":{"rating":7.9,"votes":24,"id":4125856},"type":"movie"}

The narrative goes all over the world, America, Britain, Russia and Saudi Arabia - but the country at the heart of it is Afghanistan. Because Afghanistan is the place that has confronted our politicians with the terrible truth - that they cannot understand what is going on any longer. The film reveals the forces that over the past thirty years rose up and undermined the confidence of politics to understand the world. And it shows the strange, dark role that Saudi Arabia has played in this. But Bitter Lake is also experimental. Curtis has taken the unedited rushes of everything that the BBC has ever shot in Afghanistan - and used them in new and radical ways. He has tried to build a different and more emotional way of depicting what really happened in Afghanistan. A counterpoint to the thin, narrow and increasingly destructive stories told by those in power today.","languages":["English"],"released":{"$date":"2015-01-25T00:00:00Z"},"directors":["Adam Curtis"],"writers":["Adam Curtis"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":0,"text":"1 win."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-14 23:36:33.993000000","year":2015,"imdb":{"rating":8.1,"votes":802,"id":4393514},"countries":["UK"],"type":"movie"}
