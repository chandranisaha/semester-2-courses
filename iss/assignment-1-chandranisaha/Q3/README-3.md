ASSUMPTIONS:

It is assumed that there are 2 players and the only available options are either STOP or GO.
The actions for both players are selected at random and the result is generated based on those choices.
The structure is as follows:
- if both choose STOP: both receive score of -1, no loss or gain.
- if player 1 chooses STOP and player 2 chooses GO: player 1 gets 0, player 2 gets 1  
- if player 2 chooses STOP and player 1 chooses GO: player 1 gets 1, player 2 gets 0
- if both choose GO: a crash occurs and both lose -5 

Nash equilibrium is defined as the situation when neither player can improve their score by changing their action, assuming the other player's choice remains unchanged so it's basically a DEAD END.
Two situations of Nash equilibrium are:
- Both plyers choose STOP
- Both choose GO

The game is simulated once per run assuming one run is one randomly generated round of the game.

PROMPT 1: What is the spotlight game to implement Nash eqilibrium, explain and give bash script to do it

ANS: Stoplight Game and Nash Equilibrium
The Stoplight Game is a game theory scenario where two players (drivers) are each trying to make a decision based on the other player’s choice. The two options available to each player are typically:

Go: The driver chooses to go.
Stop: The driver chooses to stop.
The game typically involves some kind of payoff matrix and illustrates a Nash equilibrium where neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.

Nash Equilibrium:
Nash Equilibrium occurs when both players make their decisions, and neither player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy unilaterally (i.e., each player's strategy is optimal given the strategy of the other player).
Problem Setup:
In this case, we will have two players:

Player 1 (Driver 1)
Player 2 (Driver 2)
Payoff Matrix:
If both players Stop, both get a "safe" payoff (but not the best).
If one player Stops and the other Goes, the one who Goes gets a higher payoff (the one who Stops gets a penalty).
If both players Go, there’s a collision, which gives a penalty to both players.
Assumptions for the Payoff Matrix:
Go/Go: Both players crash, so they get -10 points.
Stop/Stop: Both players are safe, so they get 0 points.
Go/Stop: The player who goes gets +10 points, and the player who stops gets -10 points.
Stop/Go: Similar to Go/Stop but with roles reversed.
Implementation:
Here’s the implementation of the Stoplight Game to demonstrate Nash equilibrium using random inputs.

Explanation of Code:
play_game function:

This function generates random choices for both players (either Stop or Go).
The choices are displayed for both players.
The payoff matrix is implemented as a series of if statements that determine the outcome of the game based on the players' choices.
The scores are then displayed for both players.
If a Nash equilibrium is reached, the program checks if one player chose Go and the other chose Stop, indicating that one player cannot improve their score by changing their choice.
Main Program:

The game is played 5 times, and each time the results are printed.

Welcome to the Stoplight Game!

Game round 1:
Player 1 chooses: Stop
Player 2 chooses: Go
Outcome: Player 1 stops and Player 2 goes. Player 1 gets -10 points, Player 2 gets +10 points.
Player 1 score: -10
Player 2 score: 10
No Nash Equilibrium reached.

-----------------------------------------

Game round 2:
Player 1 chooses: Go
Player 2 chooses: Stop
Outcome: Player 1 goes and Player 2 stops. Player 1 gets +10 points, Player 2 gets -10 points.
Player 1 score: 10
Player 2 score: -10
Nash Equilibrium reached: Player 1 chose Go and Player 2 chose Stop.

-----------------------------------------

Game round 3:
Player 1 chooses: Stop
Player 2 chooses: Stop
Outcome: Both players stop. Both are safe. Both get 0 points.
Player 1 score: 0
Player 2 score: 0
No Nash Equilibrium reached.

-----------------------------------------

Game round 4:
Player 1 chooses: Go
Player 2 chooses: Go
Outcome: Both players crash. Both get -10 points.
Player 1 score: -10
Player 2 score: -10
No Nash Equilibrium reached.

-----------------------------------------

Game round 5:
Player 1 chooses: Go
Player 2 chooses: Stop
Outcome: Player 1 goes and Player 2 stops. Player 1 gets +10 points, Player 2 gets -10 points.
Player 1 score: 10
Player 2 score: -10
Nash Equilibrium reached: Player 1 chose Go and Player 2 chose Stop.

-----------------------------------------
Key Points:
Nash Equilibrium occurs when one player chooses Go and the other chooses Stop (because no player can improve their situation by unilaterally changing their decision).
The game is repeated multiple times to illustrate the randomness and various possible outcomes. Each round of the game could result in different outcomes, but the Nash equilibrium is reached when one player chooses Go and the other chooses Stop.
This script effectively simulates the Stoplight Game and identifies when Nash equilibrium is achieved based on the players' random choices.










PROMPT 2: make it so that the game runs only once per round and make the score system as +1 on GO, -1 on STOP of single player and -2 on a crash of both saying STOP and keep track of their scores

ANS: #!/bin/bash

# define possible actions for the players: "stop" and "go"
actions=("Stop" "Go")  # this array holds the two possible actions for the players, stop or go

# function to simulate the stoplight game

        # if both players stop or both go, this is a Nash equilibrium (stable outcome)
        echo "this outcome is a nash equilibrium."  # both players are at a stable state where neither can improve their situation by changing their strategy
    else
        # if one player can improve their payoff by changing their action, this is not a Nash equilibrium
        echo "this outcome is not a nash equilibrium."  # at least one player can improve their payoff by changing their action
    fi
}

# run the stoplight game simulation
stoplight_game  # call the function to simulate the game with random actions for both players


Expected Output:
The program will run the simulation once with random actions for the players and will print:

The actions chosen by both players (either "Stop" or "Go").
The payoff for each player based on their choices.
Whether or not the result is a Nash Equilibrium.
Example:

vbnet
Copy
player 1 chooses to: Stop
player 2 chooses to: Go
payoff for player 1: -1
payoff for player 2: 1
this outcome is not a nash equilibrium.
This script is now more informative and includes thorough comments to describe each part of the logic behind the Stoplight Game and Nash Equilibrium detection.










PROMPT 3: give some assumptions taken by the user in writing this bash script

ANS: The Stoplight Game script assumes the following:

Two Players: The game involves exactly two players, each making one of two possible choices: "Stop" or "Go".

Limited Action Set: Each player can only choose one of the two actions:

Stop: The player stops at the intersection (no movement).
Go: The player moves through the intersection.
Payoff Structure:

Both players choose "Stop": There is no interaction, so both players receive a payoff of 0. Neither gains nor loses anything.
Player 1 chooses "Stop" and Player 2 chooses "Go": Player 1 loses (-1), and Player 2 gains (+1). This suggests that Player 1 is penalized for stopping while Player 2 benefits from moving.
Player 1 chooses "Go" and Player 2 chooses "Stop": Player 1 gains (+1), and Player 2 loses (-1). In this case, Player 1 benefits from going while Player 2 loses for stopping.
Both players choose "Go": A crash happens, and both players lose (-2). This represents a dangerous outcome where both players go at the same time, resulting in a penalty.
Random Choice for Players: The actions for both players are selected randomly using the RANDOM variable. This randomness is assumed to mimic a game where players make their choices without any prior strategy or coordination.

Nash Equilibrium Conditions:

Nash Equilibrium is defined as a situation where neither player can improve their payoff by changing their action, assuming the other player’s action remains unchanged.
The game considers two possible Nash Equilibria:
Both players choose "Stop" (neither player gains or loses).
Both players choose "Go" (neither player gains or loses, but there’s a crash and both lose equally).
In other outcomes (such as one player choosing "Stop" and the other choosing "Go"), the script assumes this is not a Nash Equilibrium because one player can improve their payoff by switching actions (e.g., Player 1 can choose "Go" to improve from -1 to 1).
Payoff Calculation: The script assumes the payoffs are calculated solely based on the actions of the two players, without considering any external factors or prior decisions.

Simultaneous Actions: Both players make their choices independently and simultaneously, and there’s no communication or strategy optimization between them. Players are assumed to act without knowledge of the other player’s action.

No Game Repetition: The game is played only once per simulation run. There is no concept of repeated games where players could adapt their strategies based on past outcomes.

Outcomes are Deterministic Based on Actions: The payoff structure is fully deterministic, meaning that once the players' actions are chosen, the resulting payoffs and outcomes are fixed and predictable.

Limitations/Assumptions Based on This Script:
No Strategy or Communication: This game doesn't model more advanced strategies, such as mixed strategies, where players randomize their actions based on probabilities. Players don't have the chance to adapt or learn over multiple rounds.
Simple Payoff Matrix: The payoff matrix is relatively simple and doesn’t account for more complex real-world decision-making processes that might include risk factors, long-term planning, or negotiations.
Only Two Possible Actions: The script assumes that "Stop" and "Go" are the only two viable actions, even though in reality, there might be more possible decisions for a player (e.g., "Wait", "Accelerate", etc.).
These assumptions are made for simplicity and to illustrate the concept of Nash Equilibrium in the context of a basic game theory scenario.
